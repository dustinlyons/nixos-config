  # Note: the installWithSecrets command you ran to boostrap the machine actually copies over

  #       instead, you can reference the age files and specify the symlink path here. Then add your
  #       public key in shared/files.nix.
  #
  #       If you change the key name, you'll need to update the SSH configuration in shared/home-manager.nix
  #       so Github reads it correctly.
